There has been a growing interest in exploring behavior, brain, and mind through the lens of complex systems theory. However, a unified and computational model that comprehensively encapsulates the properties of the human mind remains elusive. To address this gap, we propose a recurrent generative model drawing upon with Lacanian psychoanalysis and active inference. This model involves three interconnected sub-systems corresponding to three registers in Lacanian theory: the Real (R), Symbolic (S), and Imaginary (I). Every sub-system entails an active inference agent, and their interconnectivity stems from the global propagation of free energy.  We here provide a Jupyter Notebook which simulate the dynamics of this model, utilizing the Python package - [`Pymdp`](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/).
